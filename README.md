# Overview
This is a template for all environment.yml files that will be used in my future machine learning projects that use pytorch. This is a convenient template to solve environment compatibility issues so that I don't have to worrk about setting up a CUDA accelerated pytorch instance. 

The goal of this template is to standardize how code is written, checked and replicated. This will be done by having a consistent virtual environment, the use of type checking through mypy and formatting stadardization using black. 

The standardized environment template will also have REPL support through ipykernel and pretty printing loops with tqdm which all future projects will benefit from.
